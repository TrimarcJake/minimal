# Pulling Cable To My Office (Finally)
I've been having issues with skipping audio in Discord for months now. Whenever I'm a host on the Trimarc Happy Hour, I have to temporarily pull cable into my office. It sucks.

Today, I pulled a more permanent cable! This is something I've wanted to do for almost 2 years.

The difference in jitter and speed is ridiculous. I went from 7ms to 0ms jitter and 150Mbps to 650Mbps download. I can't wait to do some test calls on Teams and Discord to see if I notice an increase in quality.
