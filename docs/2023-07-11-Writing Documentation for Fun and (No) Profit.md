# Writing Documentation for Fun and (No) Profit
I know it may seem weird to some, but I enjoy writing process docs. I really enjoy taking a complex process, breaking it down into manageable repeatable steps, and finding the best way to explain those steps. By no means am I a great technical writer, but I don’t find it tedious (usually), so that’s something, right?

Anyway, a work friend recently made a major upgrade to a small open-source project. The original project was pretty simple, so its  documentation was mostly unnecessary. 

The updated version more than tripled the line count and added a bunch of new functionality, so a full set of instructions was pretty necessary. Unfortunately, this friend is not great at writing. (I'm not saying this to shame him. He freely admits it.) The instructions were not great.

I spent about an hour correcting grammar, re-ordering some information, and adding additional context/examples. I hope he likes it!
