# Locksmith (AD CS Remediation Tool) is now available!

**## Mode 4 Now Fixes Ownership Issues Automatically!**
**
**
No long-winded notes this month. Instead, I'll just wish my wife a happy birthday! She's the best. ‚ù§Ô∏èüíúüíô

Get it here: https://github.com/TrimarcJake/Locksmith/releases/tag/v2024.1

Or install from PSGallery:

`Install-Module -Name Locksmith -Scope CurrentUser`

**## Improvements:**
**
**
* ESC4 and ESC5 Ownership issues can now be auto-remediated with -Mode 4. - **_@TrimarcJake_****_
_**

* Improved RSAT installation process (if you don't have it installed yet.) - **_@techspence_****_
_**

* Modern custom object creation (no more Add-Member means slightly faster code that's much easier to read code) - **_@TrimarcJake_****_
_**

* README now shows how to use the -Scans parameter to limit your search to just a specific issue. - **_@SamErde_****_
_**

* We now have CONTRIBUTING and CODE_OF_CONDUCT docs. They're not quite where we want them, but soon! - **_@TrimarcJake_****_
_**

* PSScriptAnalyzer actions run on commit now, so we can check if there's anything hinky going on. - **_@SamErde_****_
_**

* Badges! Icons! - **_@SamErde_****_
_**

**## Known Issues:**
* Objects with both Allow and Deny ACEs reports two issues in output (I promise I'll *think* about working on this one for February. :D)
