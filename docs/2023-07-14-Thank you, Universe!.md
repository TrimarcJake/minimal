# Thank you, Universe!

Yesterday, I brought my earbuds with me to a bunch of appointments in case I wanted to listen to a thing or two while I was waiting.
 
After dinner, I decided to mow our septic mound since it was crazy overgrown. I reached in my pocket for said earbuds and discovered they were missing. I checked all the places where I thought they might be, but no luck. As a last ditch effort, I called the hospital where I had my last appointment because I remembered feeling the earbuds case in my pocket while I was there. The shockingly friendly security guard on duty told me they had my earbuds in their lost & found.
 
When I went to pick them up, he wasn't going to make me show any proof, which I thought was weird, but I opened the case and my phone lit up immediately with battery status and stuff. He was happy, and I was very happy.
