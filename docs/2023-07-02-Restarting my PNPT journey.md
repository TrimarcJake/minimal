# Restarting my PNPT journey
I bought the PNPT training bundle in October or November of 2021. I slooooowly worked my way through the first course (Practical Ethical Hacking) and competed it in January 2023. 

I'm finally picking it back up with Windows Privilege Escalation and am quickly realizing I forgot everything I knew. :/
