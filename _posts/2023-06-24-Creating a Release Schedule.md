# Creating a Release Schedule
I've been working most of the morning on a release schedule for [Locksmith](https://github.com/TrimarcJake/Locksmith) and [BlueTuxedo](https://github.com/TrimarcJake/BlueTuxedo) (still private!) that suits the teams working on each. 

* Locksmith: Me, Spencer, Sam
* BlueTuxedo: Me, Jim

It's taken way more mental effort than I expected, but I think I've come up with something that will work well for both teams.

I decided on a time-based release cadence instead of a feature-based schedule because:
1. No one is paying any of us directly for this work, so it's not high priority.

That's it. Stuff will get into the code when it works. That being said, I still think it's a good idea to delay releases if things are severely broken or missing substantial functionality.
