# Enabling MFA on Oracle Cloud

To keep track of tasks on Locksmith and BlueTuxedo, I run a Mattermost instance on Oracle Cloud. It's free for life and surprisingly performant.

They just sent me a notification about beginning to require MFA for users with administrative access.

First question: why was this not already enforced at signup?

Second question: WHY IS THIS SO COMPLEX?

I absolutely hate documentation that exists on the site/app I am currently using that isn't customized to my specific use case. Instead, I get this firehose of if/then statements.

I know Oracle can see what features I am using because they are using said features to determine who this policy applies to. Oracle, please use that visibility to customize my guidance.

Instead, I'm going to wait until this change is thrust upon me.
