# Personal Branding
I hate to admit it, but personal branding is a thing, and I'm trying to build mine. Don't get me wrong, I really love all the things I am learning by doing open-source projects and writing, and I'd do the code work even if I were independently wealthy. But writing and social media and blogs and blah blah is all so I can ultimately make more cash and send my family on more cool vacations.
